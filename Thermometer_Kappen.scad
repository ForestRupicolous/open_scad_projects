/**
  * chamferCylinder returns an cylinder or cone with 45Â° chamfers on
  * the edges of the cylinder. The chamfers are diectly printable on
  * Fused deposition modelling (FDM) printers without support structures.
  *
  * @param  height         Height of the cylinder
  * @param  radius         Radius of the cylinder (At the bottom)
  * @param  radius2        Radius of the cylinder (At the top)
  * @param  chamferHeight  The "height" of the chamfer at radius 1 as
  *                        seen from one of the dimensional planes (The 
  *                        real width is side c in a right angled triangle)
  * @param  chamferHeight2 The "height" of the chamfer at radius 2 as
  *                        seen from one of the dimensional planes (The 
  *                        real width is side c in a right angled triangle)
  * @param  angle          The radius of the visible part of a wedge
  *                        starting from the x axis counter-clockwise
  * @param  quality        A circle quality factor where 1.0 is a fairly
  *                        good quality, range from 0.0 to 2.0
